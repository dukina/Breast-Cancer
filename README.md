# Breast Cancer Detection with Heterogeneous Ensemble Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to develop a heterogeneous ensemble classifier for breast cancer detection using the BreastCancer dataset. The ensemble combines predictions from multiple classifiers trained using different algorithms.

## File Descriptions
- `Breast_Cancer_Detection.Rmd`: This R Markdown document contains the code and documentation for building the ensemble classifier, evaluating its performance, and providing insights into the dataset.
- `Breast_Cancer_Detection.html`: The rendered HTML output of the R Markdown document.
- `README.md` (this file): Provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the R Markdown document.

## Instructions
1. Install necessary R packages if not already installed:
  ```R
install.packages("mlbench")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("klaR")
install.packages("nnet")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("caret")
```

2. Open `Breast_Cancer_Detection.Rmd` in RStudio or any other compatible editor.

3. Knit the R Markdown document to generate the HTML report (`Breast_Cancer_Detection.html`).

## Libraries Used
- `mlbench`: For loading the BreastCancer dataset.
- `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
- `rpart`: For building Decision Tree classifier.
- `klaR`: For building Naive Bayes classifier.
- `nnet`: For building Neural Network classifier.
- `randomForest`: For building Random Forest classifier.
- `caret`: For evaluating model performance and generating confusion matrix.
